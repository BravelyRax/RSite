              picking up a Masters in Geology in between. I believe the world is an awesome place, full of great people,
              which drives part of my mission to make the world a better place.<br /><br />Along with my wife, Melissa,
              we co-founded Bravely with the aim to improve mental healthcare globally. Our commitment is to help as
              many people as possible, and I leverage my experiences in operations, leadership, and building to bring
              this vision to life.<br /><br />Alongside my work at Bravely, Iâ€™ve built a multidisciplinary skillset,
              specialising in early stage companies. With a reliable base of experience across product development,
              small team management and early sales processes â€” I offer a wide range of services<br /><br />Whether
